A few notes to help you get started, in terms of the conventions and syntax of this document and shell commands in general.

* Folders are often referred to as directories

* A tilde (~) usually represents your home directory or profile.

* A dollar sign ($) denotes the command prompt itself and isn't meant to be typed as part of example commands.

* The `clear` command can be used to "refresh" your command prompt at any time.  For example:

```bash
$ clear
```
